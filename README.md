This repository contains a full, open-source implementation of the **"Dragon Hatchling" (BDH)** AI architecture, based on the reference code from the conceptual paper. This project provides a professional environment to train, analyze, and explore the fascinating phenomenon of **emergence** in neural networks.

## Core Idea: Emergence

The project is built on the hypothesis that complex, functional structures can **emerge** from simple, local rules during a neural network's training. Instead of being explicitly programmed, intelligence and organization are learned properties.

This implementation allows researchers and enthusiasts to train a 25M parameter BDH model from scratch and provides the tools to "look inside its brain" to study its internal mechanisms.

## Features

-   **Faithful Implementation:** A clean, commented, and faithful implementation of the `BDHConfig`, `Attention`, and `BDH` classes.
-   **Advanced Training Script:** The `train.py` script uses modern, high-performance techniques including `torch.compile` (optional), Automatic Mixed Precision (`bfloat16`/`float16`), and efficient data loading.
-   **Reproducibility:** The project is structured for easy and reproducible environment setup using `uv`.
-   **Open-Source:** Licensed under the MIT license, encouraging community contribution and experimentation.

## Getting Started

This project uses `uv` for fast and reliable environment management. A GPU is highly recommended.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/takzen/BDH-Official.git
cd BDH-Official
```

**2. Install `uv` (if you don't have it):**
```bash
pip install uv```

**3. Create environment and install dependencies:**
```bash
# Create the virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the environment
# For Windows (PowerShell):
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# For MacOS/Linux (bash/zsh):
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install all required packages
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Run the training:**
The script will download the Tiny Shakespeare dataset and start training a 25M parameter model.
```bash
python train.py
```
*Note: The first run might be slow as `torch.compile` optimizes the model. Subsequent runs will be much faster.*

After training, the script will generate a sample text to demonstrate the model's capabilities.
